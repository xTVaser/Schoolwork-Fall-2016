                Thanks for taking the time to come and visit my website.<br>
                Can't really promise that you're going to see anything amazing here but take a look around.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a 4th Year Computer Science student at Algoma University in Sault Ste. Marie.<br>
                I enjoy solving problems for myself, but also helping others solve their problems.
                The best way to learn is always to teach.

                My interests change constantly, but the interests that never seem to change are: programming, video games and knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                For programming, at the moment I'm the most interested in Functional Programming, there is very little to learn from switching to another Object-Oriented Language, the only thing that changes in the syntax.  Rather, I am interested in learning something completely new and changing the way I approach problems as there are problems that benefit from a functional standpoint.  My functional language of choice is Haskell, and it is a very challenging one to start off with, but it is also one of the most true to the definition of a functional language.  Other functional languages I'd like to take a look at are Lisp and F#.
            </p>
            <p>
                Video games are a great pasttime and stress relief.  The two games I have played the longest are Counter-Strike 1.6 and World of Warcraft.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I truly enjoy learning more and I honestly believe that if someone does not enjoy increasing what they can do or what they know, then their curiousity has been stiffled in the past by someone with nothing to contribute.  I strongly recommend Quora to anyone else who enjoys learning as you get reputable answers with civil discussions unlike similar websites like Reddit.
