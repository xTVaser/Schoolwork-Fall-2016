# We create a fitness for the individuals, because our eval-function gives us
# "better" values the closer they are zero, we will give it weight -1.0.
# This creates a class creator.FitnessMin(), that is from now on callable in the
# code. (Think about Java's factories, etc.)

# We create a class Individual, which has base type of list, it also uses our
# just created creator.FitnessMin() class.

# We create DEAP's toolbox. Which will contain our mutation functions, etc.

# We create a function named 'random_digit', which calls random.randint
# with fixed parameters, i.e. calling toolbox.random_digit() is the same as
# calling random.randint(0, 9)

# Now, we can make our individual (genotype) creation code. Here we make the function to create one instance of
# creator.Individual (which has base type list), with tools.initRepeat function. tool.initRepeat
# calls our just created toolbox.random_digit function n-times, where n is the
# length of our target. This is about the same as: [random.randint(0,9) for i in xrange(len(target))].
# However, our created individual will also have fitness class attached to it (and
# possibly other things not covered in this example.)

# As we now have our individual creation code, we can create our population code
# by making a list of toolbox.individual (which we just created in last line).
# Here it is good to know, that n (population size), is not defined at this time
# (but is needed by the initRepeat-function), and can be altered when calling the
# toolbox.population. This can be achieved by something called partial functions, check
# https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html#functools.partial if interested.

# We use simple selection strategy where we select only the best individuals,
# now callable in toolbox.select.
toolbox.register("select", tools.selBest)

# We use one point crossover, now callable in toolbox.mate.

# We define our own mutation function which replaces one index of an individual
# with random digit.
def mutate(individual):
    i = random.randint(0, len(individual) - 1)
