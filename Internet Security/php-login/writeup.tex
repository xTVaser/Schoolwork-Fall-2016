\section*{Assignment Description}
Made with PHP and Javascript and Google Material Design Lite instead of Bootstrap.  Allows the user to create an account, login, reset their password, and verify their email after registering.  It has some basic checks inplace, such as not allowing an unverified account to login, not allowing duplicate emails to be used to login, etc.  When you login it just redirects to a simple page for now, this will be where things are improved in the coming assignments.\\

Don't use the school email because the emails get completely filtered out of hotmail due to the fact that we are using a default digitalocean VPS with no fully fledged domain.  I used Gmail to test, and the emails always were received but they went to spam.\\

I used the PHP session variables to kick the user off the secured page if they were not logged in, however I did not make the session variables expire yet.
