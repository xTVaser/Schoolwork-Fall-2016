\section*{Passive Access Report for Algomau.ca}

Website is using SSL from a certificate supplied by RapidSSL that is set to expire on August 22nd 2018.  The domain is registered through Rebel.ca Corp under the name Mr. DeConto and is set to expire on January 4th 2017.  Algomau seems to run their own DNS servers, ns3.algomau.ca and ns4.algomau.ca.  The website is making use of HTML version 5, most likely CSS version 3 and javascript.\\

Several google analytics cookies are used the website, and in addition the website is running the wordpress plugin Yoast version 3.6.1.  Yoast is an SEO plugin which major vulnerability problems \href{http://thehackernews.com/2015/03/wordpress-seo-by-yoast-plugin.html}{last year}, as well as \href{https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/05/yoast-seo-vulnerability/}{just a few months ago}.  This also brings up the fact that the website is running Wordpress, the admin login page is located \href{www.algomau.ca/wp-admin}{here} and is the default URL for it. Additional wordpress plugins that the site uses includes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Custom Facebook Feed
\item WC Shortcodes
\item Malihu Custom Scrollbar
\item Youtube Channel Gallery
\item Magnific Popup
\item New Royalslider
\end{enumerate}

The website is also making use of javascript libraries such as jQuery and modernizr.  As mentioned previously, the website is using Google Analytics and while the main domain's account details are hidden, their subdomain my.algomau.ca's account information is UA-37063246-1.  Speaking of my.algomau.ca, unlike the main website's server settings which are mostly correct but my.algomau's clock timing is off by more than 3 minutes which can cause problems.  PHP is the language of choice for both my.algomau.ca and the main pages due to wordpress.
